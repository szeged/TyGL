        // still needs to be executed) or there isn't one (because we've alraedy executed it).

        // Bottom:
        //     Instantiated as VariableDeferral(). 
        //     Means that all previous PutLocals have been executed so there is nothing deferred.

        //     that there *had* been some PutLocals that we should have executed.
        //
        // Top:
        //     Instantiated as VariableDeferral::conflict().
        //     Represents the fact that we know, via forward flow, that there isn't any value in the
        //     given local that anyone should have been relying on. This comes into play at the
        //     prologue (because in SSA form at the prologue no local has any value) or when we merge
        //     deferrals for different VariableAccessData*'s. A VAD encompasses a lexical scope in
        //     which the local has some semantic meaning; if we had stores from different lexical
        //     scopes that got merged together then we know that we're not in either scope anymore.
        //     Note that this is all approximate and only precise enough to later answer questions
        //     pertinent to sinking. For example, this doesn't always detect when a local is no
        //     longer semantically relevant - we may well have a deferral from inside some inlined
        //     call survive outside of that inlined code, and this is generally OK. In the worst case
        //     it means that we might think that a deferral that is actually dead must still be
        //     executed. But we usually catch that with liveness. Liveness doesn't always catch it
        //     because liveness is conservative.
        //
        //     What Top does give us is detects situations where we both don't need to care about a
        //     deferral and there is no way that we could reason about it anyway. If we merged
        //     deferrals for different variables then we wouldn't know the format to use. So, we
        //     use Top in that case because that's also a case where we know that we can ignore the
        //     deferral.
        //
        // Deferral with a concrete VariableAccessData*:
        //     Instantiated as VariableDeferral(someVariableAccessData)
        //     Represents the fact that the original code would have done a PutLocal but we haven't
        //     identified an operation that would have observed that PutLocal.
        //
        // This code has some interesting quirks because of the fact that neither liveness nor
        // deferrals are very precise. They are only precise enough to be able to correctly tell us
        // when we may [sic] need to execute PutLocals. This means that they may report the need to
        // execute a PutLocal in cases where we actually don't really need it, and that's totally OK.
